# Lab 8 - Starter

Tallis Dawson

1) I would do it automatically in a github action (#1), since that way it won't be forgotten and it's in often enough intervals to edit and fix the code before any problems arise
2) no
3) no, to test the message feature requires user input which is not a jest fature
4) Sure, pass a message longer that 80 chars into the function and expect an error or something along those lines
